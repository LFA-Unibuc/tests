# tests
Write valid input files for the NFA and DFA modules that you implemented.
Respect the folder structure provided in the templte. Write 3 DFA config files and 3 NFA confing files.

For every config file, write 5 tests that should be accepted and 5 tests that should be rejected. 
One test for NFA and one for DFA should be the following: 
A one config file for an automaton that accepts time  specifications. All  of  the  following examples should be accepted:
- 4 p m
- 7 : 3 8 p m
- 2 3 : 4 2
- 3 : 1 6 
- 3 : 1 6 a m


How your prgrams will be run:

`dfa.py automaton.cfg w1 w2 w3 w4 w5` (w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 are from string_{no_test})

`nfa.py automaton.cfg implementation_1 w1 w2 w3 w4 w5`

Modify your current programs to output `accept(ed)` for accepted strings, `reject(ed)` for rejected strings, and `invalid` for invalid config files.

Alternatively, for Python3 implementations, a test similar with `tester.py` can be used by me (you don't have to write the tester). For NFA, select a default implementation in your code such that it's abstracted away (use your favorite implementation as ste default one). This will bring you 0.25 bonus points. Write in the Google Sheets, 'Studen»õi' page wether you preffer this way of testing.
